1. On the Run

*Clang*
*Clang*
...
*clang*

The jarring clang of alarm bells floods the city streets and finds its way into your dreams, only to rip you from them like a riptide.
You awake from your slumber and are cast into a sea of chaos, filled with the urgent screams of your townspeople.
You cast aside your rough bedsheets, rise from bed, and slip your trembling body into a cloak before running outside
to grasp your new reality.

Outside, the world is a burst dam of people escaping from an unseen threat. Townspeople streaming through every narrow nook and cranny of the city 
streets to converge in the wider cobblestone path that leads outside of town. Every person's face contorted with fear as their homes and 
livelihoods risk being extinguished, like the torchlight in their shivering hands. 

Thrown into this moment, your gaze is drawn towards the epicenter of the commotion. The night sky is ripped to shreds by an otherworldy
white light at the towncenter. Each flash nearly enough to blind you, but each one sends a pang of curiosity down your spine. Your footsteps are forced 
towards the light. After the first several steps, within an instant you're struck by heavy debris that sends you back to sleep... As you were a moment ago...
...
...
...
A pulsing white light enters your slumber
...
...
...
Wake up
...
...
A voice enters your dreams and calls out to you
...
...
You awake in pale morning air on the hard cobblestone street of your town. You feel a crushing pang in your head, followed by the same voice...
???: Come to the town center... take me from this place..
